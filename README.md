# Pong (C / SDL2)

A simple **single-player Pong** implementation written in **C**, using the
**SDL2** library for graphics and input handling. The player competes against
a computer-controlled paddle.

This project was built as a learning exercise to explore basic game loops,
event handling, rendering, and simple AI behavior in C.

## Features
